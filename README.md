# Prelude
Prelude is a WordPress starter theme that helps you craft custom themes. It uses Gulp to compile and minify scss/css, concatenate and minify JS, compress images, and more.

## Features
### Gulp Tasks
Prelude uses Gulp to:
- Compile & minify Sass/CSS
- Auto-prefix your Sass/CSS
- Minify and concatenate JavaScript/jQuery
- Compress PNG & JPGs
- Create a theme distribution folder for local testing
- Package a theme for upload to WordPress

### WordPress Functions
Prelude has some nifty features built into `functions.php` to make developing a custom WordPress theme a little easier.
- Defer jQuery Parsing using the HTML5 defer property
- Customized Read More Links
- Other various improvements to default WordPress functions that are too long and/or small to list here

## Getting Started
Prelude requires that you have Node and npm installed on your machine. If you need help with that, please visit the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node).
1. Clone this repository to your machine, or download the .zip and place its contents in your project folder
2. Install from the project folder using `npm install`
3. Using the `theme` variable found in `gulpfile.js` name your theme (Don't forget to also fill out the theme information found in `style.css` in the root of `src/`)
4. Run the default Gulp task while editing files using `gulp` or `gulp default`

When running the default gulp task, a theme folder will be created based on the `theme` variable. You can use this folder as your theme when running locally. When you're ready to package your theme you can run `gulp package` to create a zip folder of your production theme.

## File Structure
You can modify the file structure however you like as long as it is also updated in `gulpfile.js`. Of course your project files may vary. By default it is as follows:

```

```

As mentioned in the getting started section, when the default Gulp task is ran, a theme folder will be created in the project root folder.

## Setting your default compile paths in Gulp
We have created variables to hold an array of your desired paths. This makes it so that you only need to update paths in one location. These variables are then passed into the Gulp tasks for processing.

The variables are:
- `phpFiles` - accepts an array of .php files
- `htmlFiles` - accepts an array of .html files
- `cssFiles` - accepts an array of .css file
- `sassFiles` - accepts an array of .scss/.sass files
- `jsFiles` - accepts an array of .js files
- `imageFiles` - accepts an array of image files (.jpg, .png, .gif, etc)
- `concatFiles` - accepts an array of .js files. These are used to concatenate your .js files into one file, and as such the files must be listed in the order you desire
- `copyFiles` - accepts an array of files
- `url` - accepts a string to use as the BrowserSync proxy

## List Of Gulp Tasks
There are 9 Gulp tasks available by default.
- `gulp serve` - creates a local development server with live reloading and CSS injection via [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/docs/)
- `gulp sass` - compiles SASS/SCSS files into CSS, adds vendor prefixes, and creates a sourcemap
- `gulp lint` - a JavaScript helper to find and catch errors, and creates a sourcemap
- `gulp minify-css` - ensures all SASS/SCSS is compiled to CSS and minifies them
- `gulp scripts` - concatenates and minifies JS files (in the order you declare)
- `gulp styles` - runs the `sass` and `minify-css` tasks, in that order
- `gulp images` - compresses images
- `gulp copy` - copies files from `src/` to the theme folder as named in `gulpfile.js` (This task only copies production files and leaves behind uncompiled/uncompressed files)
- `gulp watch` - watches files for changes and runs tasks based on what was updated
- `gulp package` - creates a production ready `.zip` file based on your production theme folder

Running `gulp` or `gulp default` will run all tasks except `package`.
